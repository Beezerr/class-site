    <h1>Laurel Schwulst - My Website is a Shifting House</h1>
    <p>This reading is a look into why handmade websites are still around and still important. Even with modern technology and the abundance of abilities now available when creating a website, there is still a charm that can only be obtained when sites are created by hand. I think the most important part of this reading is recognizing that these human made websites are still just as valid as the websites pumped out by bigger corporations, all of these sites are given the same opportunity of space on the world wide web.</p>

    <h1>Ursula K. Le Guin - A Rant on Technology</h1>
    <p>Technology is the active human interface with the material world. Technology isnt just hi-tech it is a way that humans can communicate, it doesnt just mean hoverboards or time machines. We as a society have been so desensitized to tech that we think that anything less than a computer is not considered tech. While some of these technologies may not be as Hi-tech as others they are still forms of technology and if these predecessors didnt exist then we wouldnt have these higher forms of technology that we have today. This is especially prevalent in the comparison of more handmade websites vs the modern standard of websites</p>

    <h1>J.R. Carpenter - A Handmade Web</h1>
    <p>Handmade web is used by J.R. to describe websites made by the human hand and mind, not just by a software. These websites are their own beings, one of a kind. While they may be a bit rougher, they have a certain charm and personality behind them that cant be obtained with a website made by software. Just like a clay ashtray made by a child vs a mass produced one, or a zine versus a hardcover publication in a library. The novelty of these handmade websites is something that cannot be bought but only learned.</p>

    <h1>Taeyoon Choi - Hello World!</h1>
    <p>The first computers were human. Computers are still just like little tiny technological humans, they speak their language of code and they store memories, just like us. All computers are made of different kinds of things and parts, they specialize in different things, but in the end they are all computers, just like we are all human. While todays computers may seem like a crazy piece of science fiction compared to the first computer, they are still just computers, they evolve just like us.</p>

    <h1>Callum Copley - A Friend is Writing</h1>
    <p>This site and the interaction feels like what we would experience in an online space with others sending their feedback as well. You click one place and read about it and more ideas and places pop up, creating an endless supply and chain of information. It is like eavesdropping on the conversations of people around you and hearing something from one group that may be interesting and focusing more on that noise. This site feels very candid in the way you explore and read, you lead yourself through what you want to read and aren't just being force fed information. It makes the web feel a bit more human, understanding your emotions and interests. </p>

    <h1>Frank Chimero - The Webs Grain</h1>
    <p>Okay, to start out, the bing-bongs scared the absolute living shit out of me, and it just got more and more cursed the longer you listened. I think if I heard that while trying to connect to the internet as a child I would never ever want to connect to the internet ever again. The internet has expanded a great deal from its smaller beginnings. The more you try to look into it the more you are sucked into different streams which can make it even more confusing and never ending. This can be overwhelming for users of the web. We have to realize that even though all of these sites we see nowadays look entirely different, that they are all made by strings and strings of code. They all have the same building blocks.</p>

    <h1>Mindy Seu - The Poetry of Tools</h1>
    <p>I really enjoyed looking through all of these works! It felt like looking at a little gallery of the web, each site creating art through code. I enjoyed the sweethearts flipbook the most, it was super interesting to look at and had a flipbook effect made through code instead of flipping paper. The Sebastian Ly Serena site also reminded me of the site we looked at in class which reminded me of the little strings of dominoes that you line up and knock down, sometimes complex, sometimes not, sometimes creating images and sometimes just made in a line.</p>

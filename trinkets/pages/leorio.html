    <p>Whenever my friends and I hangout we always go out in search of figures. On one particular hangout day we found a new figure store called Eclipse Pop, we then made it a sort of tradition to meet there first whenever we got together to see what was new. The first time we went I got a Hunter x Hunter mystery mini figure box and some pins for my bag. When we got out to my car I opened up my box to see a stupid little pink haired clown, I was very dissappointed. When we got home I shunned him to the corner and vowed from that moment that the next time we went to Eclipse pop that I would get only the best Hunter x Hunter mystery box. We go back around a month later and see them again. One of my friends birthdays is coming up and the other is in Lebanon for the summer visiting family. We go inside with one mission in mind, to capture one Gon, Killua and Leorio mystery figure. Our favorite characters for each of us. We buy three figures without looking and get out to the car to open them. When we crack them open we are struck with the most luck and good karma that any human being could possibly experience. We get all three of the figures we wanted! Leorio now sits proudly atop the frame to my closet door next to my original Hisoka figure and a Bisky I got later on.</p>

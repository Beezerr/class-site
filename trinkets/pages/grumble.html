    <p>I dont entirely remember the story behind this gem of a Digimon card other than the fact that I found it face down in a parking lot. Ever since the day I stumbled upon it it has been held in my wallet just incase I needed it. Either to trade for something or to battle. You may digivolve this card from your hand onto one of your black Tamers as if the Tamer is a level 3 black Digimon. This Digimon is a level 4 hybrid demon variety whose play cost is 5 and digivolve cost is 2 harboring a whopping 5000 DP.  I have never played Digimon but every time I look at my little Grumblemon card I hear the Digimon theme song on repeat in my head for days. I am not sure of the value of this card but to me it is more valuable than any Charizard or Blue-Eyes White Dragon.</p>

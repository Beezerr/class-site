    <p>Custom Hot Wheels car hand crafted by my girlfriend for my 21st birthday. Originally a Pixel Shaker car, the hot rod was carefully removed from its packaging and placed in a new Beezer Butler themed package. The illustration was drawn from scratch and includes details as tiny as the placement of my ear piercings. The whole car and packaging combined are emo themed with a black version of the original Hot Wheels Logo. Probably the coolest Hot Wheels to ever exist, it is a 1-of-1 making it the rarest and most swag Hot Wheels in the whole world and maybe even entire universe.</p>

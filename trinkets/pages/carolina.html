    <p>In my parents garage sits an ancient black refrigerator that holds a selection of water bottles, a random assortment of brew and the occasional diet coke. I have made it my mission to completely cover it with silly little magnets, it is my life duty to pick up a magnet wherever I see one. One roadtrip in the cold months of winter I was making my usual truckstop pop-ins  in search of a goofy little keepsake. I make my way into the Flying J truckstop, swinging open the doors. I am greeted with the smell of boiled peanuts and buzz of the intercom telling truckers that their shower stall is ready. Making my way to the back I pick up some snacks for the journey and check out the t-shirt racks. My eyes are graced with the presence of the most beautiful truck stop t-shirt I have ever seen. It is a black t-shirt with a big red semi that reads “I was haulin before you were crawlin,” I have never grown more quickly attached to something in my whole 22 years of living. I grab the t-shirt in the biggest size I can find so I can be consumed by the trucker culture and feel as if I am a real trucker myself. Just as I am walking out the door, hands full of snacks and trucker merch, I stumble upon a magnet. “Someone who loves me went to South Carolina and got me this magnet,” my hands reached for it, no thoughts just magnet. I add the magnet to the basket and make my merry way to the register where I check out and hit the road again, new treasures in tow. The magnet still graces the dusty old black fridge to this day, one of my most prized magnets in the collection.</p>

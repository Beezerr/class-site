    <p>Marcel the Shell With Shoes On was a viral video released to the internet on Youtube in 2010. I used to watch his videos growing up with my sister and we thought they were so cute and silly, we would quote him all the time. Recently they released a Marcel the Shell movie, in the film you get a longer in depth glimpse into Marcels life as well as some of the other shells he interacts with. After talking for months about how badly I wanted to watch this movie my girlfriend and I finally got around to renting it and watching it on Amazon. After watching the film, laughing and crying and experiencing all sorts of emotions in between my girlfriend turns to me and tells me she has a surprise. She goes over to her bag and fishes something out that she can cover up with her hands. She tells me to close my eyes and drops it in my hand. It is an exact teeny tiny replica of Marcel the Shell made entirely of polymer clay. My first reaction is asking her where she got him. You wouldnt believe my shock when she told me she made him herself. He sits on my record shelf in my room where he dances to all the jams and he even made a surprise visit in my dialogues class.</p>

    <p>Naruto froggy coin pouch given to me by my girlfriend as a gift a while back. He sits on a shelf in my bedside table looking out into my room with a derpy look on his face. Never before has he ever held a single coin in his mouth, but I still appreciate him just being there. He is plush and super soft, his mouth clicks open and closed and there is a little message sewn inside, although im not entirely sure what it says. He has been a trinket that has lived through the entire duration of me living in my apartment in the fan. Although he is not a real pet, my landlord doesnt allow them, he still greets me with a nice familiar face at the end of a long day when I enter the safety of my room. Ribbit!</p>

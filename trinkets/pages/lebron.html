    <p>In July of 2021 there was a trend where people were going around taking the Lebron James heads off of Space Jam 2 figures. For months Target was plagued with the theft of the heads of this specific toy to the point that they had to make an announcement about it stating that they were increasing their loss prevention measures. Eventually they began to manufacture the packaging so that it was not possible to take the heads off without purchasing the product. When we first moved into our apartment in the fan my roommate and her boyfriend and I took a trip to the nearby Target for some apartment essentials. When we got out to the car my roommates boyfriend opened his hands to reveal a fresh and shiny Lebron head to offer as a housewarming gift. When we got home we placed his head atop an empty bottle of Espolon on our liquor shelf which is where he sits to this day, pridefully looking over his kingdom.</p>

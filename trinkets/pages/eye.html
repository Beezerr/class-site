    <p>My freshman year of college I went through the Art Foundations program at VCUarts. In this program we had to take different types of studios that resulted in all sorts of different forms of art. Never did I ever think that my education for my fine arts degree would include having to create 100 little eyeballs with ping pong balls, yarn veins, and printed pupils. In my time studio, a studio meant for forms of video and performance media, I created a blinking eyeball sweater. This sweater was created for a performance art piece called Ive Got My Eyes On You. It was meant to make the viewer feel how the performer felt by reflecting back on to them the feeling of being watched. The sweater was rigged with a battery powered string of lights and put on a flashing setting during the performance to imitate blinking through the thin white plastic of the pong ball. For my performance I was a glob of blinking eyeballs sitting on the floor with a haunting tune playing in the background. I have never been a big fan of being the center of attention, so me and performance art were not friends. We still arent. I still have a gallon bag full of plastic ping pong eyeballs waiting in a dark drawer in my desk. Waiting for the day they can stare back again. </p>

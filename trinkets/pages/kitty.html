    <p>RVA Antiques, an antique store on Lakeside in Richmond is one of my favorite antique stores to visit for home goods. While scrolling on instagram I came across the most beautiful florentine style mirror for sale and knew I had to have it. I grabbed my keys and headed for Lakeside. I step foot in the store for the first time and I am overwhelmed with the sight of little trinkets and decor. On the way to the stall with the mirror I see out of the corner of my eye the silliest canvas tote bag with a chicken printed on it. Above the chicken reads, I poop my breakfast, whats your superpower? I grabbed the bag on the way to the back and kept my eyes peeled for more trinkets. Nearing the stall I find a bag full of vintage boyscout patches and pins, one of the pins being a hand sewn felt cat. I have never seen a cuter pin in my whole entire life. My chicken bag is my daily bag to this day, its decorated with all my boyscout patches and a random assortment of pins, including this little skrunkly kitty cat.</p>

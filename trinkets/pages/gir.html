    <p>For months on end I, Beezer Butler, was in search of Invader Zim plush danglies. I heard through the grapevine that they were being sold at five below. I checked five below religiously for days, days turning into weeks and those weeks turning into months. Eventually I gave up hope and stopped searching for the plush danglies, assuming that it was all just a cruel prank. On one random afternoon over the summer my friends and I stopped into Second and Charles. The Invader Zim plush danglies had not crossed my mind for months, I had completely forgotten about their existence. We are walking through the aisles of merchandise when all of the sudden I hear one of my friends call out my name. I rush over to her and stop dead in my tracks. There is a box of Invader Zim plush danglies, completely full. I didnt just grab one box, no, I got two. I had waited so long to get my hands on one, the whole time I had desperately wished and prayed that I would get a Gir plush danglie. I had to increase my chances. We get out to the car and my friends rip open the boxes. The first box holds an angry gir without his dog costume on, good but not good enough. We open the second box, waiting with baited breath, hoping to catch a little glimpse of green fuzz. We all scream. Out of the box comes a Gir in dog costume plush danglie, the little robot in disguise of my dreams. Gir hung on my rear view mirror next to a Rei from Evangelion plush danglie for months until they were overthrown by the Illumi Hunter x Hunter keychains which now reign supreme.</p>

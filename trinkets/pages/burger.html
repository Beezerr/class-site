    <p>Cheeseburger Squishmallow from a set of four junk food themed Squishville, including french fries, a taco and a dumpling that looks like a little bag of garbage. Acquired during a squish hunt with Jenna while in search of the manatee squish clip. She had searched many targets, the only place selling the manatee clip, and lost hope. One day, on a whim we took a trip to a nearby target, manifesting the manatee clip. We go inside with one mission in mind, with little hope but our heads held high we head straight for the toy section, two girls on a mission. Mission manatee squish clip. We turn down the aisle with the plushies and beeline for the squishmallows. Right in front of our eyes appears a fresh box of squish clips with the manatee squad, including four heaven sent little manatee clips. We grab all four clips, one for each of us. This feeling of success and triumph needed to be celebrated, and what better way to celebrate than to pick up even more squishmallows. I grab the pack of Squishville and my manatee clip and check out, walking out the door, bag full of squishmallows, a full heart and a wallet that is not so full. </p>

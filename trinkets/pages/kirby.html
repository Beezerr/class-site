    <p>Barnes and Noble can be a dangerous place. With its endless supply of books, overpriced vinyls, legos and most importantly, trinkets. One afternoon while in Barnes and Noble looking in the manga section I browsed the usual shelf that is close by of tiny key chains, mystery boxes and plushies. There is a display box with the cutest mystery box I have ever laid my eyes on. Kirby mystery box. The grip mystery boxes have on my little fish food pellet of a brain is truly frightening, whenever I see one I cant help myself. I grab the box and head for checkout with my books in hand. Out in the car I open the box hoping for sleepy Kirby, my shock when I open the box to sleepy Kirby on the first try is unmatched. Sleepy Kirby joins my other dashboard trinkets, every time I see him I want to curl up and take a nap or play some Kirby on my switch. </p>

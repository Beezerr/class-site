    <p>Official Buc-ees sticker from a tag attached to black Buc-ees logo boxer shorts. In the summer of the year 2022, the month of June to be exact, four friends went on an east coast road trip from Richmond, Virginia to Jacksonville, Florida. On the way we visited plenty of truck stops in search of cheesy truckstop t-shirts and the elusive moth Squishmallow. Traveling down we passed billboards for the Buc-ees for almost a hundred miles, a new one popping up every two feet, our brains were littered with Buc-ees propaganda. None of us have ever laid eyes on a Buc-ees, nor did we know what exactly it was, so we made it our mission to stop in Florence, South Carolina to breathe the Buc-ees air. A few hours into the 8 hour road trip back to Richmond we pulled off the highway in pursuit of the Buc-ees. We waited in a long line of cars for almost 20 minutes just to get into the parking lot. After miraculously finding a parking spot, we burst through the doors in hopes of living all our truck stop dreams. It is so crowded inside, you could barely get past people without bumping into them or a display of beaver nuggets. We gathered up all the Buc-ees merch we could find and hit the bathrooms. We finally hit the road again in our matching boxer shorts with a big ol bag of beaver nuggets for the long ride home. </p>

    <p>This Littlest Pet Shop butterfly is the only Littlest Pet Shop I have left in my possession. When I was a kid my sister and I used to have loads and loads of Littlest Pet Shops, houses and playsets for them to play in and even a plug and play video game. One of my favorite collectible stores called Oddballs Collectables in Merchants Walk shopping center sells a whole bunch of collectables and trinkets, including early 2000s toys, walking in there is like walking back into 2005. In the back there is a stall that sells old video games that I always like to browse on my trips there. Right next to it there is a locked case with Pokemon cards, Hot Wheels, DS Games and most importantly, Littlest Pet Shops. One day when browsing the games I noticed a particularly bug eyed looking Littlest Pet Shop. I needed to have it. I walk to the front and ask them to unlock this case for me solely for the purpose of purchasing this 1 dollar Littlest Pet Shop butterfly. It now sits on my dashboard with my other trinkets, its head doesnt bobble anymore because the sun in the summertime beats through my windshield with heat that even Hell cant compete with. </p>

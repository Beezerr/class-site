    <p>Workplace violation given by officer Luke on 7/30/21 at 8:02 PM, citation number C-175430D. Received this violation during my last week of employment for being too cool for the burger ppl. Other points of violation include, not cleaning up after yourself, I cant believe you wore that to work, something smells and we think its you and OMG I cant even. Accurate diagram of the location is provided in a sketch showing exactly where the incident took place.  Neither just kidding nor not kidding box were checked, to this day I still dont know if this was given for a real offense or just for the funnies. Not entirely sure how officer Luke had the authority to issue a ticket from the Office Police as it was given in a restaurant, not an office space. Kept this ticket in my records in case I was called to appear in court. I am a fugitive on the run.</p>

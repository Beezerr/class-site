    <p>The most cursed Gyro Zeppeli figurine to ever grace the planet earth. With manga accurate Valkyrie and Teddy. This figure is part of a set of figures my friends and I carefully crafted, formerly little soldier figures bought from Michaels. We molded new forms for them and attached them with sculpey for outfit pieces and hair and gave them completely new paint jobs. We have fully completed the Golden Wind characters with manga and anime accurate table and teapot full of Abbacchios special brew. The Steel Ball Run characters have yet to be completed, we got a little too ambitious with the inclusion of Valkyrie and Slow Dancer. One day they will be complete and we will move on to another Jojo part, although we arent sure which we will take on next. </p>

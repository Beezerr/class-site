    <center><h1>WORLDS SMALLEST MINION ORNAMENT</h1></center>

    <p>This teeny tiny minion was once a display ornament in a Hallmark store. Near the window by the front of the store they have ornaments so tiny that they are probably only the size of my pinky finger, this minion included. My girlfriend and I went to the Hallmark to look for Link ornaments from the Legend of Zelda because I saw a Windwaker and Breath of the Wild one on twitter. I found the Breath of the Wild Link Ornament but had no luck with the Windwaker one. We leave the store and get out to my car. My girlfriend reaches over to me with a surprise. I open my hands and down drops a microscopic minion ornament. It now graces the branches of my christmas tree, barely seen because of how much of a speck it becomes in comparison to normal sized ornaments.</p>

    <p>Hobby Lobby, the shittiest craft store on the face of the planet, besides the fact that they have good fabric and the occasional trinket. One day my girlfriend and I waltzed into Hobby Lobby to look for some sort of craft ingredient, I cant remember exactly what. When in the model hobby aisle we see Hunter x Hunter mystery key chain clips. Our other friend already has a Killua clip, I wanted a Leorio clip and my girlfriend wanted a Gon clip. I grab two of them and we head for the car to unbox them, hoping for anyone but Netero. We open them in the car, beyond excited when we open the first one to reveal Gon. I go to open mine, I say that if I dont get Leorio I hope I get Illumi. Out pops a little teeny Illumi Zoldyck, we look at each other in shock, our jaws on the floor. I take my prize and clip him on my rear view mirror so I can be reminded of my victory everywhere I go. He now has another Illumi clip hung right next to him with another outfit variation that I pulled from another mystery pack. They are my protectors, the Volkswagen Tiguan assassins.</p>

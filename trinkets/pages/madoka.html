    <p>Short Pump Mall has a plethora of stores to shop at, one store in particular was there as a pop up shop two years ago. It was a little hut outside the H&M where they sold a bunch of fun toys, plushies, and collectables. One day while shopping at the mall with my sister we stopped by the store and checked out their wares. She picked up a few pairs of chopsticks and what I found would forever change the course of my life. Madoka Magica playing cards. Madoka Magica was one of my favorite animes growing up, and at the time there was rarely any merch being sold of it, so these cards were like a godsend for me. I pick up the cards and check out super excited to check them all out once I got home. All of the cards have illustrations of the different witches they come across and the Joker card is Kyubey, the evil little alien cat that turns them into magical girls. I have never actually played with this deck of cards because they are too precious, they just sit in my drawer collecting dust. Every so often I will pull them out to glance at them but never to play a game of BS or War. </p>

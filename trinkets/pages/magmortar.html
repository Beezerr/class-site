    <p>I go in for a normal weekend serving shift, the kind where I am there from open to close. It was a grueling Saturday shift, I barely had time to think and I was full on NPC mode greeting tables. One table in particular showed up that Saturday night when things had started to slow down just a bit. My section was sat with a two top, a mom and her son. The son was a bit hyper bouncing around in the booth seat, his mom telling him to sit down and chill. They had just come from the store where he picked up a pack of Pokemon cards which he told me about very excitedly. He was opening them while they were waiting for their food and dropped one on the floor. He reached down to grab it but his mom yanked him up and told him the floor was dirty and to leave it till after he had eaten his dinner. They leave after they finish their meals, leaving the card forgotten on the floor. I go to pick it up and flip it over to be greeted with a Magmortar card. I tuck it away in my server book where it has stayed for two years, just in case he comes back one day looking for his lost card.</p>

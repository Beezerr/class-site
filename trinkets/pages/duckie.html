    <center><h1>TEENY TINY PLASTIC DUCK</h1></center>

    <p>One rainy morning in the early fall of the year 2022 I went in to set up the bar for my weekend shift at 23rd and Main. I walk through the back door and I am immediately greeted by one of my coworkers yelling about little ducks. She tells me that her and my manager have been finding them around the restaurant in random spots the whole morning even though they were the only ones there. Someone had to have done it the night before. But who was the duckie perpetrator? We spent all weekend looking around for teeny plastic duckies and collected a little over 20 in total. All the ducks were kept stashed away in the duck cup, a plastic to-go cup with duck cup written on the front. The mystery of who hid the little teeny tiny ducks was still looming over the tiny taphouse in Church Hill. Nobody knew who did it and if they did they were very tight lipped. Eventually, after weeks of finding more plastic ducks, the duck hider revealed themselves along with new information. This new information was that we had only found a small fraction of the duck army. There were over 60 ducks hiding in that restaurant. To this day there are probably still some hiding.</p>

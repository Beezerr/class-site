    <p>Calico Critter mystery bag kitty cat in a ghost costume. The trophy of all Calico Critters, long have I searched for him. Occasionally on my stops in Barnes and Noble I will peruse the Calico Critter section in hopes of finding a cute new critter. For a time they were selling Calico Critter mystery bags where you would get a critter and a costume that fits it. All the critters were displayed on the back except the mystery critter, the glow in the dark ghost kitty cat. I wanted it. I needed it. My desire to hold this little ghost kitty cat Calico Critter and to be able to call it mine was like no other, it was consuming. I would walk into the Barnes and Noble and head straight to the Calico Critter section for the next few months, praying that I would rip open the bag and be blessed with a scraggly little white kitty cat and its shell ghost costume. Every trip I would take them out to my car and record unboxing videos for live reactions to send to my friends, unfortunately every video ended in disappointment. One fateful day, my sister goes to the Barnes and Noble without me. She decides that she wants to try her luck in the ghost kitty mystery Calico Critter race. She comes home with a scraggly little white kitten Calico Critter and ghost costume in hand, bragging to me about how she got it on her first try. To this day he sits in her room on her dresser, taunting me, every time I pass him I consider catnapping him. </p>
